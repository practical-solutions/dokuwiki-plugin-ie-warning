# DokuWiki-Plugin: Internet Explorer Warning

Very simple DokuWiki-Plugin showing a warning message or blocking access to the page when the Internet Explorer is used. Very simple coding. For more enhanced options / programming use the existing [NoIEWarning-Plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:noiewarning).

## Options

  * Option to show warning only to logged in users.
  * Additional message text
  * Additional CSS for the message box
  * Completely block access for the internet explorer
  * Block logging in to the wiki when using the internet explorer

## Why another IE Warning Plugin?

The Internet Explorer ist still the standard and often only browser installed in many companies, resulting in a lot of problems. In dokuwiki
many important plugins fail in the Internet Explorer, e.g. CKGEditor, draw.io, etc. Thus a simple warning message ist essential, especially
for editors lacking advanced technical knowledge.

## Compatibility

Tested with
* DokuWiki / **Hogfather**
* PHP **7.3**
