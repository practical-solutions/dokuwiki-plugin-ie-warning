# DokuWiki-Plugin: Internet Explorer Warning

Very simple DokuWiki-Plugin showing a warning message when the Internet Explorer is used. Very simple coding. For more enhanced 
options / programming use the existing [NoIEWarning-Plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:noiewarning).

## Options

Option to show warning only to logged in users.

## Why another IE Warning Plugin?

The Internet Explorer ist still the standard and often only browser installed in many companies, resulting in a lot of problems. In dokuwiki
many important plugins fail in the Internet Explorer, e.g. CKGEditor, draw.io, etc. Thus a simple warning message ist essential, especially
for editors lacking advanced technical knowledge.
